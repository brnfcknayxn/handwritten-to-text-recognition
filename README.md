# handwritten-to-text-recognition

This project is basically performed in jupyter notebook.

Here i have mentioned some of the applications which can be implemented using ocr techmology - 
•	Automatic number plate recognition.
•	Automatic documents key information extraction.
•	Make electronic images of printed documents searchable.
•	Assistive technology for visually impaired users.
•	The automated entry of data by OCR is one of the most attractive, labor reducing technology.
•	The recognition of new font characters by the system is very quick and easy.
•	We can edit the information of the documents more conveniently and we can reuse the edited 
  information as and when required.

I have downloaded the datatset from kaggle , there are many datasets available there , you can download any of them.

Good Luck for your project guys...
